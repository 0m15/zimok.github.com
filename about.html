<h2 class="page__title">Me</h2>
<div class="page__content">
  <p>My name is Simone. I was born and raised in Southern Italy. I moved to Rome in 2005 and I still live there. I'm an User Interface developer. My skills covers many parts of the whole front end development process, so I do wireframes, analyze metrics, mock up ui elements in photoshop, build working prototypes,
  design and iterate through the product and develop its behavior based on a solid Javascript stack.
  I totally embrace the open source culture and I try to open as much as possible of what I make. Take a look at my github account.
</p>
<h2 class="page__title">What I don't do</h2>
<p>
  There'are also a lot of things I don't do. Here they are:
  <ul>
    <li>I won't develop the front-end for your cms like Joomla, Magento, Wordpress, etc.</li>
    <li>Make your site look the same on 32 different browsers on 671 different devices</li>
    <li>Use that fancy jquery slideshow-parallax-multitouch-a-la-pinterest-plugin if the only reason for doing that is to be &quot;cool&quot;</li>
    <li>By the way, when possible I try to avoid on relying on jquery plugins</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2 class="page__title">Cloudnoi.se</h2>
<p>The original purpose of cloudnoi.se was to serve a little javascript application I did as an exercise while learning Backbone, some times ago. If you're looking for that, now is here: http://cloudnoi.se/app</p>
