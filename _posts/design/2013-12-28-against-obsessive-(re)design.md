2013 will be remembered as the Year Of Redesign&trade;.

Probably a big role in this game was played by the iOS 7 release which generated a sea of
criticism against its designer John Ive and every part of the UI that could've been criticized.
From icons to backgrounds, passing through typography and colors. 
It turned out in a mass game, that apparently seemed to be an innocue, wether not constructive, critic: just redesign it to show to the world how good we'd have been if only Apple had hired us.

All re-design were pointing to what seemed to be the most natural way to do things: just make something beautiful and nice to see and it'll work well.

That's totally wrong.

Things that work well aren't necessarily beautiful. 
An UI that works well hasn't to be necessarily nice.

Most of all, it's not a matter of taste, it's a matter of user feedback.

None of the redesign we've seen on Behance and Dribble were based on feedback.
Real feedback, not the one from who is just saying: "this gradient is ugly".

Following trends in design, making a thing as nice as possible, isn't ever a guarantee that the design will work.

I can make you an infinite list of examples just to mention the most widespreaded interface system existing today and used by the masses. Think about:

- Bank's ATM
- Vending machines
- Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, eBay
- Maps
- Road signs
- Newspapers

Do they follow any trend? Absolutely not. ATMs just lets you select among some options and withdraw money. They don't need to be nice to see. There's no reason why they should adopt another font than Helvetica.

As well as people uses vending machine to buy a snack, amazon to buy an home teather and facebook to send pictures of kittens to the friends.

Facebook (and not only him) is adopting what I call a *cheap interface*, or better, what I'd refer as "Transparent User Interface", that doesn't mean "No Interface at all" (I hate this expression, btw). It means that the interface follows its natural function and seems to be a natural extension of the whole system, like our arms and feet are an useful extension of our body, which is an extension of our brain. We use our hands in a functional way, like we should do with interfaces.

Google+ was simply a flop to the masses, and its UI explains all: it's everything but cheap. 
It gives you the idea that someone like a graphic designer, or worse, an artist, designed it.

When you read a Newspaper you never think about its design, because it's transparent. You read it. As the verb suggests, you're not observing, neither admiring it. It's not an artwork. It's a newpaper. It works because it lets you read. 

Facebook, Amazon, Google adopt the cheapest interface I've ever seen. 
It shows you the information you need. It lets you post a message, buy a think or search something.
It works.

As far as I know, no facebook user has ever complaint about avatar shape.

So, why is all this obsessive (re)design wrong? It's simply not design. 

It's a style exercise, something nobody is forbidding to you, but it's better to call it with its proper name: style exercise. It does not solve any problem. It doesn't even address a problem, which is the core of design. 

Addressing a problem. Finding a solution. Testing it. Repeating it.

So, before starting compulsively redesigning something, please ask to yourself which problem you want to solve as the first step. If the answer is something like "I just want to make it nicer", you should be aware that this might not be necessarily a problem and you'd rather better picking a real one.
