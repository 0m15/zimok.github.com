title: The agony of hope
---

I hope you noticed the cite from [Daniel Pennac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pennac)
on this blog's sidebar (or from the header, if you're on a smartphone). If you don't know a little bit of french, it says:

> <cite>Parameter's list is the agony of hope. Nothing will ever work fine
> if you think about every thing it needs to work fine</cite>

This quote is becoming like a mantra, for me.
Because it's, and it has been, unquestionably true.

Our minds are full of workflows and processes to follow.
Full of parameters list to attach on the wall. To repeat them mumbling, with the same obsession a practicing catholic says the rosary.
It seems we won't start anything without assuming that we have to  religiously take the pattern *XYZ* in order to get everything done in the right way.

There are a lot of people telling you to abandon Photoshop, that you don't need wireframes, that you have to first sketch it on paper, that you have to do style tiles, that you have to do it in vectorial, no wait, in Fireworks, no, wait again, design everything in the browser with LiveReload. Embrace that Agile pattern, approach it with Mobile first.

Use _this Library_, _that Process_, _this Workflow_, otherwise bad things will happen.

For me, there's no definitive process.

My process changes given two variables:

1. product requirements
2. my current mood

The same workflow will never work the same way for every different product we are building.

This is due to the nature of the __medium__ we build for.
User needs raises and changes as the medium does. Design processes too.
We can simply predict, but never be sure to know what all this thing called *web* will become tomorrow.

Therefore, we can simply adapt ourselves &ndash; and our processes &ndash; 
to adhere to the medium and its ecosystem, composed by different users, devices and __contexts__.

Another factor is our mood. It seems that nobody take in consideration the psychologic side.
This assumes that we're like robots, and that we work like a robot in an assembly line, without any superstructure conditioning our work.
Instead, it's likely that the process I'm following will be heavily influenced by how I feel.

The perfect workflow should be conformable to us human beings, so it should be imperfect by nature, as we are. 

Conclusion: the perfect workflow still does not exist, and never it will.

I simply feel there are some moments I'm confident with a process, and I rely on it. Other times, I like to make the process driven by my __sentiments__.

And never let an aseptic list of parameters kill my hope.

Note: this applies for everything.
