In Italy we have a problem called Police.
In Italy we use to torture.
We use to torture inside police stations, inside jails, inside judicial hospitals,
they torture you in court's security rooms too. I'm not exaggerating. Torture happens
in this country and this fact is [well documented].

It's the first time I write about those argoments in my not so perfect English.
There aren't so much journalists writing about it, and informations are hard to spot, they usually take little space on newspapers and are badly treated from Italian main stream media whom, due to fear or servility &ndash; or both, always avoid to take position and tell the very truth.

We are the "Diaz" country.

For those who weren't aware, in "Diaz" School, on July 22, 2001, happened what Amnesty
International (and not a rioter) stated to be as the 
    
> <cite>most serious human rights suspension in a western democracy since the Second World War</cite>

Those were like war days. 

A civil war, triggered by very violent and trained fringes ofthe polices forces, mostly composed from Carabinieri and Polizia di Stato, under the aware direction of some well known figures from the Italian Government, like [Gianfranco Fini] who have never disowned their actions.

G8 summit was taking place in Genova, the first Italian city to free up itself from the Nazifascist oppression.

Genova is a town with continuous references with our country most recent History, due to its numerous Working Class and Port struggles ("Portuali genovesi" have a certain fame).
Fascists expulsion on June 30, 1960 - when the city was literally in the hand of antifascist protestors for 3 days in order to prevent a provocatory convention of the MSI (Italian Social Movement), a party mainly composed by some of the worst remembered former figures of Italian fascist experience - give a clear idea of what Genova is and what kind of people *Genovesi* are.

In order to guarantee the *security*, Genova was militarized and blinded months before.
It has been seen as an heavy provocation. 
Citizens was denied to access some areas, unless they owned a special pass.
Lot of policemen and military forces came in the city from all over the Italy.

At that time a global opposition movement existed.
It was one of the biggest movement in Europe after 70s, it was a mix of insurrectional anarchists and pacifists, comunists and ecologists, church's associations and alter-mondialist.

It was an etherogeneous force, even contradictory, but never seen before.

In the minds of our governors that people had to be blocked.
It had to be tortured, killed, it had to suffer terrorism, both physic and psychologic.

There was a counterpart that day. It was the Italian Republic.
The same Republic based - as far as its Consitution is telling us - on democracy and civil rights. A Republic born from Resistance to Nazi-fascism.

Those were like war days.

[Carlo Giuliani], a 23 years old protestor who was resisting at the violents and unjustified &ndash; as a [sentence declared] &ndash; police's charges in Tolemaide Street, was brutally shooted at the head.
Then they passed over him with a Land Rover Defender (of which Italian armed forces are furnished).
He died after about 20 minutes of agony.
During this terrible minutes, there were some other Policemen and Carabinieri that threw stones at his crane, breaking it. Another one lighted off a cigarette on his body.
Several other officiers spat on him.
A photographer, who was taking pictures of what was happening, was violently grabbed from an officier, beated and then made drag over Carlo Giuliani's blood. 
Finally, the camera was damaged and film destroyed, but there are some other pictures, taken from another photographer who was on a terrace, documenting this fact. 
There are a couple of movies which reconstruct these facts, "[La Trappola]" and "[OP Genova 2001]".
The military officier who shooted and killed Carlo Giuliani has been assolved for acting for self-defense. 

After another day of protests and violences, the following night, the one between July 21 and July 22, at the Diaz School &ndash; where some demonstrators were passing the night, waiting to go back to their homes &ndash; it began a brutal police irruption.
About 100 men broke into the School while almost all people were sleeping.
What followed was a total massacre, cruel and premeditated.

93 people were arrested and all of them were injuried, a lot of them in very serious conditions.
Two of them went in a coma.
One was a British journalist who didn't found any other place in the city to have a rest, but even if he had been a dangerous "black block" (like Italian press use to call some protestor), the question would have irrimediably been the same.

Although it happened just by chance, there were no deads, luckly.
Police said that they found 2 molotov bombs inside the school, but, as successively demonstrated, they were brought there from the same policeman as a fake evidence to justify the irruption.

Of all the Diaz massacre responsibles, nobody have ever spent a single day in prison.
On the contrary, 10 demonstrators, accused of "devastation and looting" (so, only for damages at things and not at people) have seen far heavy pains inflicted and confirmed in the *Cassazione* (Italy's last degree of judicement), pains varying from 6 years to 14 (fourteen) [years of reclusion].

Everything passed last summer under total indifference from the press, the government and the so-called civil society.

After 10 years, nothing is changed.
There are a lot of other stories about police crimes, most of them unpunished.

Just to cite some of the most known, Federico Aldrovandi (18), Gabriele Sandri (26),
Giuseppe Uva (37), Stefano Cucchi (31), Aldo Bianzino (44), were all accerted victims of unjustified, unsensed and brutal police violence.

An association, called "victims of police" was founded from Federico Aldrovandi's mother ([Patrizia Moretti], a very strong woman who leaded a very hard and brave battle to have justice for her child's murder. A [website](http://www.abusodipolizia.it) is trying to collect stories, witnesses, news and facts documenting police's abuse in Italy. 

Abuses of which a lot of people, from the government to the catholic church, passing through a lot of left-wings intellectual (whereas most of right-wing people is likely to approve police brutality without any shy), journalists, prosecutors, are not only aware but real accomplices of, day by day, with their shameful silence.
