In Italy we have a problem called Police.
In Italy we use to torture.
They torture inside police stations, inside jails, inside judicial hospitals,
they torture you in court's security rooms too. I'm not exaggerating. Torture happens
in this country and this fact is documented. ([1])

It's the first time I write about those argoments in my not so perfect English.
It's not written about it so much, and informations are hard to spot, or badly treated from Italy main stream media whom, due to fear or servility, or both, they always avoid to take position and tell the very truth.

We are the "Diaz" country.
For those who were'nt aware, in "Diaz" School, on July 22, 2001, happened what Amnesty
International stated to be as the 
    
> <cite>most serious human rights suspension in a western country since the Second World War</cite>

Those were like war days. 

A civil war, triggered by very violent and trained fringes ofthe law enforcement, in particular from the Carabinieri and Polizia di Stato, under the
aware direction of some well known figures from the Italian Government, like Gianfranco Fini.

There was the G8 in Genova, the first Italian city to free itself from the Nazifascist occupation.
A town which have continuous references with our country most recent History, due to its numerous Working Class and Port struggles ("Portuali genovesi" have a certain fame).
The expulsion of the fascists from the town on June 30, 1960 - when the city was literally in the hand of antifascist protestors for 3 days in order to prevent a provocatory convention of the MSI (Italian Social Movement), a party mainly composed by some of the worst remembered former figures of Italian fascist experience - it's a clear example of what Genova is and what kind of people *Genovesi* are.

It was an heavy provocation.
The town was militarized and blinded months before.

At that time a global opposition movement existed.
It was a scary movement, it was a mix of insurretional anarchists and pacifists, comunists and ecologists, church's associations and alter-mondialist.

It was an union of forces, etherogeneous, even contradictories, but never ever seen before.

That movement must be blocked. It had to be tortured, killed, it had to suffer terrorism, both physic and psychologic.
There was a counterpart that day. It was the Italian Republic. 
The same Republic based - as far as its Consitution tells to us - on democracy and civil rights. A Republic born from the Nazifascism Resistance.

Those were like war days.

Carlo Giuliani, a 23 years old protestor who was resisting at the violents and unjustified police's charges in Tolemaide Street ([2]), was brutally shooted at the head.
Then they passed over him with a Land Rover Defender (in dotation to Italian armed forces).
He died after very long minutes of agony.
During this time, there were some other Policemen and Carabinieri that threw stones at his crane, breaking it. Another one lighted off a cigarette against his body.
Several officiers spat on him.
A photographer, who was taking pictures of the scene, was violently grabbed from carabinieri, beated and then they made him drag over the blood of Carlo Giuliani. 
Finally, the camera was damaged and film destroyed, but there are some pictures, taken from another photographer who was on a terrace, documenting this fact. You can see this in the documentary movie "La trappola" ([3]).

It's good to remember that this was happening just about 10 years ago, in 2001.
After another day of protests and violences, the following night, the one between July 21 and July 22, at Diaz School, where some protestors were staying, it happened a brutal police irruption.
About 100 men broke into the School while almost all people were sleeping.
What followed was a total massacre, cruel and premeditated.

93 people were arrested and all of them were injuried.
Two of them went in a coma, in serious conditions.
One was a British journalist, but even if he had been a dangerous "black block" (like Italian press use to call them), the question would have irrimediably been the same.

Only for a miracle, there were no other victims.

Of all the Diaz responsibles, nobody have ever spent a single day in prison.
At the contrary, 10 demonstrators, accused to have procured damages at the private property (and not at people) have seen far heavy pains inflicted and confirmed in the Cassazione (last degree of judicement in Italy), pains going from 6 years to 14 (fourteen) years of reclusion. ([4])

Everything passed under total indifference from the press, the government and the so-called civil society.

After 10 years, nothing is changed.
There were a lot of other stories about police crimes, the vast majoirity of them were unpunished.

Just to cite some of the most known, Federico Aldrovandi (18), Gabriele Sandri (26),
Giuseppe Uva (37), Stefano Cucchi (31), Aldo Bianzino (44), were all accerted victims of unjustified, unsensed and brutal police violence.

An association, called "victims of police" was founded from Federico Aldrovandi's mother (Patrizia Moretti, who leaded a strong and brave battle to have justice for her child murder. A [website](http://www.abusodipolizia.it) is collecting stories, witnesses, news and facts and document police's abuse in Italy. 

Abuses of which a lot of people, from the government to the catholic church, passing through a lot of left-wings intellectual (whereas most of right-wing people is likely to approve police brutality without any shy), journalists, prosecutors, are not only aware but real accomplices of, day by day, with their shameful silence.
