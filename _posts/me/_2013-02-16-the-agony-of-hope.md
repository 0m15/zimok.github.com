title: The agony of hope
---

I hope you noticed the quote from [Daniel Pennac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pennac)
on the sidebar (or the header). If you don't know a little bit of French, it asserts:

> <cite>Parameter's list is the agony of hope. Nothing will ever work fine
> if you think about everything it needs to work fine</cite>

This sentence is becoming like a mantra.
Because it is, and it has been, unquestionably true, at least for me.

Our minds are full of schemes to follow. We can't live without those parameters lists. We're attaching them on the wall. We're repeating them mumbling, with the same meticulousness a practicing catholic recites the rosary. It seems we won't start anything without assuming that we have to religiously take the pattern *XYZ* in order to get everything done in &ldquo;the right way&rdquo;.

Take whatever guide, book, ux fellow, design guru. They're basically telling you how to do things.
They're telling you to do things in one way. That one way. I'm personally a skeptical by nature.
I don't believe them. Or, better, I believe that what they're telling me to do, works fine for them.

I'm not referring to a particular technique, pattern, process. I'm not saying that your technique will fail as is. I'm saying that your technique it's likely going to fail if applied to the wrong context.

For me, there's no definitive process.

My process changes given two main variables:

1. the product
2. my current mood

## Several contexts, several processes

The same workflow will never work the same way for every different product we are building. Moreover, a product is made of several contexts and, the deeper we go into them, the sooner we'll recognize how is it difficult, if not impossible, to apply the same pattern for all.

This is due to the nature of the __medium__ we build for.
User needs raises and changes as the medium does. Design processes too.
We can simply predict, but never be sure to know what all this thing called *web* will become tomorrow.

Therefore, we can simply adapt ourselves &ndash; and all our theoretical luggage &ndash; 
to adhere to the medium and its ecosystem. Not the contrary.

## Imperfect by nature

Besides, there's the mood. It seems that nobody take in consideration the psychological side.
This assumes that we're like robots, and that we work like a robot in an assembly line, without any superstructure conditioning our daily job.

Instead, it's likely that what I'm designing will be heavily influenced by how I feel.

The perfect workflow should be conformable to us human beings, so it should be imperfect by nature, like we are. 

Conclusion: the perfect workflow still does not exist, and never it will.

I simply feel there are some moments I'm confident with a process, and I rely on it. Other times, I like to make the process driven by my __sentiments__.

And never let an aseptic list of parameters kill them.

Note: this could be applied for everything in the life
