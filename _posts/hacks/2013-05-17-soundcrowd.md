During my attend at [Music Tech Fest](http://musictechfest.org), I took part at the Music Hack Day too.

The hack topic was to "make noise". 
More precisely, judges asked participants to show the "best noise in da house".
So, with [Davide](http://twitter.com/tanototo) we decided to pick up 
labels that were present at the MTF on Soundcloud (one of the available providers).
Davide exctracted comments from the hottest tracks and then I turned data into
a nice visualization made up with [D3.js](http://d3js.org).

Soundcrowd's aim was to demonstrate capabilities of [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web_Audio_API). 
We decided that the noise would've been generated by speak synthesizing every comment in real-time.
We didn't have time to build a speech-syntesizers though, so we searched and found [Speak.js](https://github.com/mattytemple/speak-js), a library
that makes browser based speech synthesis very easy to implement.

You can see it in action (you're going to hear a lot of voices, so turn down the volume):
