Rbot.fm is a music recommender bot.
It works thanks to Twitter Streaming and Echonest apis.
A listener waits for every mention to [@rbot_fm](http://twitter.com/rbot_fm), and, based on the tweet text and the provided hashtag, it basically makes two things:

1. Extracts the artist name from arbitrary text (via Echonest's experimental Artist extraction method)
2. Replies to you with a #similar artist or a #radio playlist based on the matched artist and a link to Deezer

It's still an alpha and a little bit buggy, especially in the part that involves Artist entity extraction from the tweet text.

In order to see it in action, just send a tweet to [@rbot_fm](http://twitter.com/rbot_fm) like one of these example:

- [@rbot_fm](http://twitter.com/rbot_fm) give me #similar to Daft Punk
- [@rbot_fm](http://twitter.com/rbot_fm) #radio for Lali Puna
