Seedr is a concept spotify app I developed while learning the apis.
The app simply tries to predict and recommend artists you may like using echonest. The mechanism is pretty straightforward: a call to the spotify api fetches your toplist, then the app calls echonest api to get similar artists.
The result is almost an infinite number of recommendations, since for every artist you have in your toplist there are at least 20 other related ones that, reduced to a normalized list of unique entities, is still quite big to guarantee interesting results.

Plus, it's AngularJS powered, it means that lots of Spotify's `View` and `Api` methods are translated to proper Angular directives and services. 

At the time the app is still "offline", it means that it's not publicly available on Spotify yet, since it still misses some important parts and has got some bugs, and I don't know if I'll ever send it to Spotify.

However, you can download it and, as far as you have a Spotify developer account (you can enable it for free from Spotify), you can install it by placing under your Spotify folder (it depends on your OS, checkout the [official reference]) and then (after re-starting Spotify) you should be able to launch it by typing `spotify:app:seedr` in the search bar.
