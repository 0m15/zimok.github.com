&quot;Celo-Manca&quot;, literally *I got it, I missed it* is the hack I made at the [HackItaly](http://hackitaly.org) event. It tries to solve a very simple &mdash; but yet annoying &mdash; problem: I know the lyrics of a song, but I can't find it on any music lyrics provider. The solution would be to transcribe it, but it would be pretty boring and slow as kind of process.

Instead, it would be much easier &mdash; and most of all, funnier &mdash; to simply sing and let a speech recognition system doing the boring part (writing it down).

The equation came up pretty easily: [webSpeechRecognitionAPI](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API) + your voice.

The hack essentially lets you sing along a song (or in solo-mode) recognizing what you're saying.
You can further edit the resulting text and then send it to [MusixMatch](http://musixmatch.com) (one of the API providers).

The hack could be extended with some other ideas, like:

- make the lyric shareable
- add a karaoke game 
- display a list of songs with missing lyrics from musixmatch

To see it in action, you'll need the latest version of Google Chrome.
